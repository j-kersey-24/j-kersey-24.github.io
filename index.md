#### Home Credit Default Risk

Home Credit wants to serve customers who are unbanked or lack credit history, so they need to identify if an applicant is capable of repayment or likely to have payment difficulties. I created a supervised classification model to predict whether or not the client is likely to have difficulties repaying the loan based on the application and supplementary data.

#### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
